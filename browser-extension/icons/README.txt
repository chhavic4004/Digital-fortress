Create 3 icon PNG files here:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can:
1. Download placeholder icons from https://via.placeholder.com/16 (change number for size)
2. Use any image editor to create custom icons
3. Use an AI image generator with prompt: "cybersecurity shield icon, red and black theme, minimalist"

The extension will work without icons, but the badge will look broken.
For now, you can use any PNG file and rename them accordingly.
